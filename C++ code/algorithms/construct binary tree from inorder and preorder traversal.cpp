/* Preorder traversal - root node -> left node -> right node
Inorder traversal - start at root process left sub tree -> root - > right sub tree

problem is solve for finding binary tree from these 2 traversals

in the preorder we know what is the root and find that root in inorder and figure out left and right subtrees
