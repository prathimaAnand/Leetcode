/* Problem statement: The array is split into half and flipped
A target value is given and we need to return index of the target value.
Trivial method is comapre every element with target and return the one that matches.
Memory - O(n)
We are taking an advantage of the roatated sorted array to fnd the target value.
Using Binary sorting
WKT that binary search has 3 pointers - left, middle and right
